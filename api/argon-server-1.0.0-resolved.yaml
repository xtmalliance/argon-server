Instead, the user would like to know the likely outcome if the action were hypothetically attempted.  The response to this request will not refer to an actual flight plan, or an actual state change in an existing flight plan, but rather a hypothetical flight plan or a hypothetical change to an existing flight plan.

          - `IfAllowed`: The user would like to perform the requested action if it is allowed.  If the requested action is allowed, the USS should actually perform the action (e.g., actually create a new ASTM F3548-21 operational intent).  If the requested action is not allowed, the USS should indicate that the action is Rejected and not perform the action.  The response to this request will refer to an actual flight plan when appropriate, and never refer to a hypothetical flight plan or status.

          - `OffNominal`: The flight plan now reflects the user's actions, but the flight plan is not in a nominal state (e.g., the USS has placed the ASTM F3548-21 operational intent into one of the Nonconforming or Contingent states).

        A coded expression that provides information about what is authorised /
        forbidden in a zone that has conditional access.

        By difference with the “Message” field per zone, this coded expression
        is made to be interopreted by the UAS while the “Message” is to
        interpreted by the remote pilot.

        NOTE: the maximum field length is 10 000 characters.

        ---------------------- Condition definition language ---------------- •
        A list of relevant characteristics (CHARTYPE) has first to be
        established per state, and their finite list of acceptable values
        (CHARVAL)

        • Each chartype and charval fields are defined by a limited set of
        characters

        • A public document shall give the definitions of each, and provide the
        reference to legal or technical characteristics implied

        • The Geozone editor per state can use these characteristics, with the
        dedicated condition language defined below, to define exact conditions
        per zone

        • Each UAS Geofencing function shall be loaded with the corresponding
        chararacteristic status of the UAS for the intended flight, so as to be
        able to apply the conditions , either to generate alerts or to limit the
        flight

        • If the value of a given characteristic of the condition equation is
        not defined in the UAS, the UAS Geofencing function should inform the
        pilot in Geoawareness alerting or consider that the zone is forbidden,
        by default in automatic Geofencing.

        A conditional expression shall be of the following type:

        • The UAS is PERMITTED XOR PROHIBITED (exclusive choice) to fly in this
        zone at this time IF (Characteristic1) CHARTYPE1 = (Value1) CHARVAL1 AND

        CHARTYPE 2 = CHARVAL 2 AND ... AND End IF

        OR (...)

        ...

        End OR

        • Only the fields in bold need to be edited in the character string,
        separated by”/”. Others are implicit.

        Examples of CHARTYPE and CHARVALUE:

        • CHARTYPE: operator type; Acceptable CHARVAL values:
        Military/Police/Firefighting

        • CHARTYPE: Operator ID (registration number); Acceptable CHARVAL
        values: as per registration format

        • CHARTYPE: Operation type: A1 as per EASA Open Types or S1 (National
        standard Scenario 1), STS01 (EASA Specific standard scenario) or ...

        • CHARTYPE: UTM operation type: Planned/Unplanned,

        • CHARTYPE: passengers on board: yes /no Note that it is possible in
        each national catalog of chartype and charval items, to define complex
        categories of operation/drone /equipment. Example: In nation A, we may
        have a type “drone level” with values Low, Medium, High. Each level
        corresponds to a defined set of required UAS performance/operation
        features/ operator qualification etc. This avoids to code a complex
        combination in the geozone database. This conditional expression can
        also be used to code a prohibition of image capture in a zone.

        Example: PERMITTED/IMAGE CAPTURE=NO/NOISE

          CLASS=A/OR/OPERATOR=POLICE

        Meaning: >-
           the fight is permitted in this zone at that time if No image is
        captured (removed or deactivated) and if noise class = class A
        (following a known classification) or if the UAS operator is the Police

    description: You can submit geo-fences as GeoJSON into Argon Server, Argon Server will convert the GeoJSON to a ED-269 Geofence in the background, use these operations into Argon Server.
  - name: geozone-qualifier
    description: The InterUSS monitoring test suite has developed a series of tests to check compliance for ED-269 geofences as part of the EU U-Space regulations, these endpoints interact with the qualifier test suite.
  - name: telemetry
    description: Argon Server enables GCS and trackers to submit telemetry data for processes, use this end point to submit the telemetry data.
  - name: message-signing-verification
    description: Argon Server provides security related features for signing of requests and responses. These endpoints provide data about public keys that can used to verify messages on Argon Server and also in environments outside Argon Server
